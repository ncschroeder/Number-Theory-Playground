# Number Theory Playground
This project has been worked on solo and currently consists of 2 Java programs, one for a command line interface and the other for a 
graphical user interface. In each version, the user can go to different sections. Each section can teach the user about and do calculations 
for number theory concepts. I am currently working on a website version of this project.

## All the sections:
- One that teaches the user about prime numbers and allows for input of a valid number and the program outputs the first 30 prime numbers that appear after that number
- One that teaches the user about twin prime numbers and allows for input of a valid number and the program outputs the first 20 pairs of twin prime numbers that appear after that number
- One that teaches the user about prime factorizations and allows for input of a valid number and the program outputs that number's prime factorization
- One that teaches the user about divisibility tricks and allows for input of a valid number and the program outputs the divisibility info for that number
- One that teaches the user about greatest common factors (GCDs) and least common multiples (LCMs) and allows for input of 2 valid numbers and the program outputs the GCD and LCM info for those numbers. The GCD can be calculated using 2 methods and the LCM can be calculated using 1 method.
- One that teaches the user about the Goldbach conjecture and allows for input of a valid number and the program outputs the pairs of prime numbers that sum to that number
- One that teaches the user about Pythagorean triples and allows for input of a valid number and the program outputs the first 10 Pythagorean triples that appear after that number

## Directions for running from command line
1. Have a java development kit that can compile a Java program that has all the Java features I used. My jdk is version 11.0.8.
2. Download this repository
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository was downloaded
4. Run command "javac *.java"
5. Run command "java NTPGUI" for the GUI version or "java NTPCLI" for the command line version

## Why I decided to make this
During the summer of 2019, I took a number theory course on brilliant.org for fun and I was enlightened by some of the stuff I was
learning. Later that year, I was thinking of what kind of programming projects I could work on and some of the stuff
I learned from that number theory course came to mind. I realized I could make a program that makes calculations about some of the stuff I learned.
Along with the content of that number theory course, I also included additional number theory concepts that I was familiar with.
I learned these other concepts from sources such as my discrete math textbook and YouTube videos from channels such as
Numberphile, Mathologer, 3blue1brown, and Zach Star. 
I decided to use Java because it is a popular programming language that I had no familiarity with at the time. However, 
I found Java easy to learn since some of the syntax is similar to C++, which I had some familiarity with.
